### 1)American sign laguage detection and recognition-
American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities. Here we are using OpenCv and Machine learning to predict the words which are described by the motion of hands. The same work can be done using sensor based approach but this will eventually result in the loss of natural motion of hand thus decreasing efficiency of the system. To increase the efficiency we are using the vision based approach thus resulting in the increased efficiency of the system.
