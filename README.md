## Theme - Making life easier
### 1)Anti-Depressionn companion Bot-
Depression is a real problem out there in current world. We are proposing a solution to counter this problem by using Deep Learning to help improve the quality of life thus **making life easier**. The project focuses on detection of facial features of the face with the help of Deep learning and analysing it to keep track of one facial expression over a period of time using the WebCam of the laptop or can be moulded into an seperate individual bot. If the expression detected are sadness, disgust and contempt over a period of time then the system starts showing the person good things in form of thoughts and happy memories. If the condition persist the concerning authorities are informed and thus eliminating accidents occuring due to depression.

### 2)ComPydre-result 
ComPydre is a chatbot  made using Zulip which can provide us with result to any query requested by the user by scanning the keyword and choosing most suitable result for it. The bot can also fetch audio files or video files. ComPydre can be deployed for different organisations to help them with the general queries which are asked frequently and thus automating the interaction between the client and the organisation. With every keyword matched the bot will show the relatable content alongside with a response further asking for any query.  

### 3)American sign laguage detection and recognition-
American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities. Here we are using OpenCv and Machine learning to predict the words which are described by the motion of hands. The same work can be done using sensor based approach but this will eventually result in the loss of natural motion of hand thus decreasing efficiency of the system. To increase the efficiency we are using the vision based approach thus resulting in the increased efficiency of the system.
